# cassette-player

Cassete player is a music player created with SVG and manipulated with snap.svg and javascript.

You can create any player with svg and you just need to give them the rights ID. The javacript will find the ID and control it.

There are the available player controls and IDs:

* #play - your play button should haves this id
* #forward - your forward button should haves this id
* #backward - your backward button should haves this id
* #rec - your rec button should haves this id
