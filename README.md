# cassette-player

Cassete player is a music player created with SVG and manipulated with snap.svg and javascript.

You can design any svg player and you just need to give them the rights IDs. The javacript will find all the ID and manipulate them.

These are the available player controls and IDs:

* #play - your play button should haves this id
* #forward - your forward button should haves this id
* #backward - your backward button should haves this id
* #rec - your rec button should haves this id
